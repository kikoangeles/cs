         <em>Present Day (2020s)
             <br>
             <br><br> Times are changing and this is evident by the social media landscape today. Now, we spend more and more time on short-form content apps such as TikTok and Instagram. <br>
             According to a research done by abcnews.go, teens spend on average seven hours and 22 minutes on their phone. And according to the same study, 8-12 year olds spend four hours and 44 minutes on their phones.<br>
             This means that there is indeed a shift from long-form content to short-form video content that can be accessed through a phone.<br>
            The cinema industry has already felt these effects as more and more cinemas have been closing down due to the pandemic and a lack of customers.<br>
            Luckily, some companies like HBO have adapted to the changing times by creating HBO Max, a movie and tv streaming platform. Disney also has adjusted well as they have been spending more time on "shorts" on their Disney+ platform. <br>
            Moving forward, it is clear: more and more teens and kids prioritize convenience and quick content. This is why, for the movie industry to stay afloat, it is important to innovate and create new, short forms of content.<br><br>
